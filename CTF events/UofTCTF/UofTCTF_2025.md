## Misc

### Misc - Surgery

I was thinking of getting some facial contouring plastic surgery done, but didn't know who to go to. My friend said they had a recommendation for a doctor specializing in that, but only sent me this photo of some building. Who's the doctor? Before submitting, wrap the doctor's name in uoftctf{}. Special characters allowed, [First] [Last] format.

For example, if the name was Jean-Pierre Brehier, the flag would be uoftctf{Jean-Pierre Brehier}
