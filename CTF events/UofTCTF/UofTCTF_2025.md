## Misc

### Misc - Surgery

I was thinking of getting some facial contouring plastic surgery done, but didn't know who to go to. My friend said they had a recommendation for a doctor specializing in that, but only sent me this photo of some building. Who's the doctor? Before submitting, wrap the doctor's name in uoftctf{}. Special characters allowed, [First] [Last] format.

For example, if the name was Jean-Pierre Brehier, the flag would be uoftctf{Jean-Pierre Brehier}

With a picture search, we found that the tower belongs to JK Plastic Surgery Clinic.
Go to the website and find the surgeon.

### Misc - Math Test

The server gives a flag if you solve all 1000 tasks correctly, by automating it with a script on python we can get a flag easily.

Use script below to connect the server and solve all 1000 math questions and get flag!

    import socket
    import re
    
    def solve_equation(equation):
        """Solve the given mathematical equation."""
        try:
            result = eval(equation)
            return int(result)  # Convert to integer if required by the server
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error solving equation: {equation}. Error: {e}")
            return None
    
    def main():
        host = '34.66.235.106'  # Server IP address
        port = 5000             # Server port
    
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            try:
                s.connect((host, port))
                print("Connected to the server.")
    
                while True:
                    data = s.recv(4096).decode('utf-8')  # Increase buffer size
                    if not data:
                        print("Connection closed by server.")
                        break
                    
                    print(f"Received: {data.strip()}")
    
    
                    match = re.search(r'Question:\s*([^\n]+)', data)
                    if match:
                        equation = match.group(1).strip()  # Extract the equation
                        print(f"Solving equation: {equation}")
    
                        # Solve the equation
                        answer = solve_equation(equation)
                        if answer is not None:
                            print(f"Sending answer: {answer}")
                            s.sendall(f"{answer}\n".encode('utf-8'))
                        else:
                            print("Could not solve the equation. Exiting.")
                            break
                    else:
                        print("No valid equation found in the received data.")
                        break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")
            finally:
                print("Disconnected from the server.")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

## Crypto

### Crypto - Funny Cipher

A wheelbarrow ran over the flag. Can you fix it?

look at the title and look for wheelbarrow cipher
