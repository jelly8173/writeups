### Task - Hidden Genome Message 


A codon is a sequence of 3 molecules/nucleotides describing an amino acid in the sequencing of DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) or transfert (tRNA). Each nucleotide is described by a letter (among A, C, G, T, U) and the codon can therefore be described by these 3 letters, but also by the name of the amino acid.

The letters A, T, C, G, U from nitrogenous bases mean respectively Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine and Uracil.
